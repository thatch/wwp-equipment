    Take 4 shots with Canon 10D, Sigma 8mm f4 EX Circular Fisheyey Lens and Agnos QuicklyQT Standard Rotator. We use Panoweaver 4.0 internal version to stitch the 4 shots. Panoweaver 4.0 is the upcomming upgrad version of 3.01 which supports SLR camera. The core algorithm has been fulfilled. But the GUI design is not available now. Therefore it is only for internal use in Easypano. Hopefully it will be released by the end of this year. This bridge panorama is just an attempt for using our new techonolodgy.<br><br>
